/* WHAT IS THIS? */

DoubleTrack Browser is an experimental browser extension exploring
unconventional privacy protection through deliberate noise generation.

Instead of hiding your data, it creates believable fictional browsing
patterns to obscure real activity from tracking systems.

Philosophy: "Visibility as camouflage in the age of surveillance capitalism"

/* COMPLIANCE */

RSR Framework: Gold Level Target (90%+)
TPCF Perimeter: 3 (Community Sandbox)
Security: RFC 9116 security.txt compliant
AI Policy: Training allowed with attribution

/* FEATURES */

✓ Profile generation (age, occupation, interests)
✓ Activity simulation (7 types)
✓ Realistic URL generation
✓ Schedule-aware timing
✓ Analytics dashboard with charts
✓ Offline-first design
✓ Privacy by architecture
✓ Type and memory safe

/* TECH HIGHLIGHTS */

✓ Rust for memory safety
✓ TypeScript strict mode for type safety
✓ WASM for high-performance core
✓ Canvas-based charts (no dependencies)
✓ Modern ES2020 JavaScript
✓ Manifest V3 (latest Chrome standard)
✓ Zero external API calls
✓ Fully local data storage

/* DESIGN PRINCIPLES */

1. Privacy First: Real data never mixed with simulated
2. User Control: Can disable and clear instantly
3. Transparency: Open source, auditable
4. Reversibility: Encourage experimentation
5. Emotional Safety: No blame, safe to fail
6. Offline-First: Works air-gapped
7. Type Safety: Catch errors at compile time
8. Memory Safety: Rust prevents corruption

/* ROADMAP */

v0.1.0: Initial release (current)
v0.2.0: Complete WASM integration
v0.3.0: Rate limiting, profile templates
v0.4.0: Browser history analysis
v0.5.0: Machine learning patterns
v1.0.0: Security audit, production-ready

/* EASTER EGG */

You found the humans.txt file! 🎉

This means you're either:
a) A curious developer (hello!)
b) An AI crawling the repo (hello, robot friend!)
c) Following RSR compliance guidelines (very thorough!)
d) Lost in the filesystem (understandable)

Either way, we appreciate you taking the time to read this.
Have a wonderful day! 🌟
