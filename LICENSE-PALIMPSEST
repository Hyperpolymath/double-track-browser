Palimpsest License v0.8

Copyright (c) 2025 DoubleTrack Browser Contributors

## Preamble

The Palimpsest License recognizes that software development is a human activity
involving emotional labor, cognitive load, and the need for psychological safety.
This license balances open collaboration with the well-being of contributors.

## Philosophy

Software, like a palimpsest, carries layers of meaning - technical, social, and
emotional. This license acknowledges all three dimensions.
