## Governance Model

### Decision-Making Process

**Type A: Routine Decisions** (bugs, docs, refactoring)
- Any maintainer can merge after review
- 24-hour minimum for review window
- LGTM from one P1 steward required

**Type B: Feature Decisions** (new capabilities, API changes)
- Discussion in GitHub issue first
- 72-hour minimum discussion period
- LGTM from majority of P1 stewards
- Lead maintainer has veto power

**Type C: Governance Decisions** (CoC, license, TPCF changes)
- Public RFC process required
- 2-week minimum discussion period
- Unanimous approval by all P1 stewards
- Community input strongly considered

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Direct Communication**: Parties attempt to resolve privately
2. **Mediation**: Neutral P1 steward mediates if needed
3. **Lead Decision**: Lead maintainer makes final call if unresolved
4. **Fork Option**: Dissenting parties may fork under MIT terms

### Succession Planning

**If Lead Maintainer Steps Down**:
1. 30-day notice preferred (not required)
2. Existing P1 stewards elect new lead
3. If no P1 stewards remain, most senior P2 contributor promoted
4. If project abandoned, MIT license permits forking

**Adding New Core Stewards**:
- Requires unanimous approval of existing P1 stewards
- Minimum 12 months as P2 contributor
- Demonstrated commitment to project values
- Invitation-only, not requested

## Perimeter Management

**Perimeter 1 Expansion Triggers**:

## Time Commitments

### Expected Availability

**P1 Stewards**:

- Respond to security issues within 48 hours
- Review PRs within 1 week
- Participate in monthly sync (when P2 activated)
